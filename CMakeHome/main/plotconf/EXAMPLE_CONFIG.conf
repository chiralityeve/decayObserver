# After a PLOT keyword you can plot simple 1D plots. Note: if the expression at unit matches an alias for cut defined above 
# the associated cutdefinition is used - otherwise the cut as described below is taken as the cut.
# If you want to leave out some entries type " " (with a space inbetween) or for cut "1" to not cut on anything

# The structure is:

# or for plotting a variable on the same canvas as the last PLOTVAR:
